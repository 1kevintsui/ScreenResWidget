A simple app that wraps around the Qres.exe to quickly swap screen resolutions. Application supports defining your own screen res sizes inside the config.ini file. Also allows you to map a pseudo hot key (2 key combination outlined in config) to toggle between the two resolutions. This was made for use on windows 11, where the start menu is in the center of the screen. I can add in functionality to move it around if anyone except me wants it.
